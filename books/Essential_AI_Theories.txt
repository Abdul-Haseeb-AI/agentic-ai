Key Topics and Definitions

1. Artificial Intelligence (AI):  
	Definition: Simulation of human intelligence in machines.  
	Example: Siri, Alexa.

2. Machine Learning (ML):  
	Definition: Systems learning from data to improve over time.  
	Example: Spam filters.

3. Deep Learning (DL):  
	Definition: Neural networks with multiple layers analyzing data.  
	Example: Autonomous driving systems.

4. Learning Types:  
	Supervised: 	Labeled data for prediction.  
	Unsupervised: 	Clustering without labels.  
	Reinforcement: 	Reward-based learning.

5. Neural Networks (NN):  
	CNNs: 		For image processing (e.g., facial recognition).  
	RNNs: 		Sequential data (e.g., language models).  
	LSTMs: 		Long-term dependency handling.

6. Other AI/ML Concepts:  
	Overfitting: 	Learning noise instead of patterns.  
	Transfer Learning: 	Using pre-trained models.  
	GANs: 		Generator-Discriminator networks.

7. Performance Metrics:  
	Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score.  
	Confusion Matrix: Visualize model performance.

8. Algorithms:  
	SVMs, Decision Trees, Random Forest, PCA, K-Means Clustering.

9. Transformer Models:  
	Example: BERT, GPT.

10. Practical Tools:  
	TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Keras, OpenAI GPT, Pandas, NumPy.
